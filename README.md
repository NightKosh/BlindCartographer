# BlindCartographer

**Blind Cartographer** is a lightweight quality-of-life mod for Valheim that enhances navigation, especially in "No Map" mode.

## Features

- **Quick Pin Placement**  
  Add pins to the world map without opening the map UI. Just look at an object (like a resource node, firepit, ore, dungeon entrance, etc.) and press `LEFT Alt + T` to create a pin using its name(or custom text by your choice).

- **Map Access via Cartography Table**  
  In "No Map" mode, the cartography table becomes your only access point to the world map â€” just like a true adventurer would rely on maps at camp.

## Details

- You can pin nearly any interactive world object: resources, workbenches, entrances, and more.
- A simple popup appears to name the pin, with keyboard and mouse input support.
